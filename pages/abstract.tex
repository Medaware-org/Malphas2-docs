\xsection{Abstract}{3}
The aim of this document is to outline the architecture and design choices that were made during the development process
of the second revision of Malphas.
Malphas is a digital logic simulation software implemented as a web-application. It allows users to visually model and simulate
logic circuits. In the second revision, we focused on improving the performance of the circuit editor, implementing a wide
range of quality-of-life improvements, as well as fixing various bugs.
