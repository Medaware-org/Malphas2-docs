\vspace{\baselineskip}
The above quote demonstates just one of the many known bugs in the first version of Malphas. And while countless issues
and curious behaviours still plague the entire frontend, tha particular bug mentioned in the quote has successfully been
tracked down and resolved. Although the exact reasons for why this fix works are between \verb|JavaScript| and God,
what seems to have caused was re-building the \verb|AST| inside of the callback of \verb|traverseAllAsts(...)|, i.e.
\begin{lstlisting}
 traverseAllAsts(this.ast, (node) => {
	...
        if ('location' in node) {
        	if (this.rayCast(this.snappedMousePosition, node.element.geometry()
				as unknown as [number, number][], node.location)) {
                	deleteCircuit(deleteNode, () => {
                        	this.rebuildAst()
                        })
                }
        }
})
\end{lstlisting}
It is worth mentioning that the way \verb|deleteCircuit| is implemented, is that the lambda callback is only triggered
after an asynchronous request completes, which may explain the undefined behaviour.
